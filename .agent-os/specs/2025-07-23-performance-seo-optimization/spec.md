## Overview

Implement comprehensive performance optimization and SEO enhancements for the GNOME application portfolio website to achieve Core Web Vitals scores >90 and improve search engine visibility. This optimization will enhance user experience through faster loading times and better discoverability while maintaining the authentic GNOME experience.

## User Stories

### Fast App Discovery

As a GNOME user, I want the portfolio site to load quickly and smoothly, so that I can discover applications without waiting for images to load or experiencing layout shifts.

**Workflow:** User visits the site → Images load progressively without blocking initial render → User can immediately interact with the app grid → Subsequent navigation is near-instantaneous with proper caching.

### Search Engine Discoverability

As a potential GNOME user searching online, I want to find the portfolio site and specific applications through search engines, so that I can discover quality GNOME apps without already knowing about the portfolio site.

**Workflow:** User searches "best GNOME applications" → Site appears in search results with rich snippets → User clicks through → Individual app pages also appear for specific app searches.

### Offline App Browsing

As a GNOME user with intermittent internet connection, I want to browse previously visited apps offline, so that I can reference application information even without connectivity.

**Workflow:** User visits site with connection → Service worker caches app list and visited pages → User loses connection → Can still browse cached apps and access basic information.

## Spec Scope

1. **Image Optimization System** - Implement WebP conversion, responsive images, and optimized delivery for all app icons and screenshots
2. **SEO Metadata Implementation** - Add comprehensive meta tags, structured data markup, and Open Graph tags for search engine visibility

2. **Enhanced Search Presence** - Site appears in search results with rich snippets for app discovery queries
3. **Offline Functionality** - Users can browse previously visited app information without internet connection
