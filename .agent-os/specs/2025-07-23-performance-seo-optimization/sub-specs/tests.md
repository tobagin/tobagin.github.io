- Test background sync capabilities (if implemented)

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Performance Scenarios**
- Test first-time visitor experience (cold cache)
- Test returning visitor experience (warm cache)
- Test mobile vs desktop performance characteristics
- Test performance degradation with slow network conditions

**SEO Validation Workflows**
- Test search engine crawler accessibility
- Test social media sharing preview generation
- Test app-specific page discoverability in search results
- Test rich snippet display in search results

**Offline User Experience**
- Test offline app browsing scenarios
- Test service worker update process when online
- Test graceful degradation without service worker support
- Test offline indicator and messaging

## Mocking Requirements

### External Services
- **Flathub CDN:** Mock image requests for testing optimization pipeline
- **Google PageSpeed Insights API:** Mock performance measurements for automated testing
- **Search Console API:** Mock sitemap submission and indexing status

### Network Conditions
- **Slow 3G Connection:** Simulate performance under constrained bandwidth
- **Offline State:** Test service worker behavior without network connectivity
- **Intermittent Connection:** Test resilience to connection drops

### Browser APIs
- **Intersection Observer:** Mock for lazy loading tests in environments without browser
- **Cache API:** Mock service worker cache operations for unit testing
- **Performance Observer:** Mock Web Vitals measurements for consistent testing

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Automated Performance Monitoring
- **Lighthouse CI Integration** - Run performance audits on every deploy
- **Core Web Vitals Tracking** - Continuous monitoring of key metrics
- **Performance Budgets** - Fail builds if performance regresses beyond thresholds
- **Real User Monitoring** - Collect performance data from actual users (privacy-respecting)
