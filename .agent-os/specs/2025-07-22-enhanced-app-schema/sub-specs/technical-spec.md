# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-enhanced-app-schema/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **YAML Schema Extension:** Add four optional string fields to the app.yml structure without breaking existing entries
- **Template Integration:** Modify Jekyll app detail templates to conditionally display resource links when available
- **UI Component Design:** Create consistent resource link section following GNOME HIG design principles with appropriate icons
- **URL Validation:** Implement basic format validation for provided URLs to catch common errors during data entry
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure resource links display appropriately across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- **Accessibility:** Provide proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for all resource links

## Approach Options

**Option A: Flat YAML Structure**
- Add fields directly to root level of each app entry
- Simple to implement and understand
- Cons: May become cluttered as more fields are added

**Option B: Nested Resources Object** (Selected)
- Group all resource URLs under a `resources` key
- Cleaner organization and easier future extension
- Cons: Slightly more complex template logic

**Rationale:** Option B provides better organization and makes future additions cleaner while maintaining backward compatibility. The nested structure clearly separates resource links from core app metadata.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. Implementation uses existing Jekyll, SCSS, and JavaScript infrastructure already in place.
