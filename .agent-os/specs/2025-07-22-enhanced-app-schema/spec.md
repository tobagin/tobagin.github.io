# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced App Schema
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the current app data structure by adding comprehensive resource linking fields (docs_url, wiki_url, issues_url, discussions_url) to provide users with unified access to all project resources from a single location.

## User Stories

### Comprehensive Resource Access

As a GNOME user exploring applications, I want to access all project resources (documentation, wikis, issues, discussions) from the app's detail page, so that I can quickly find help, contribute feedback, or learn more without navigating multiple platforms.

**Detailed Workflow:** User visits an app page, sees clearly labeled resource links in a dedicated section, clicks to access documentation for usage guides, visits issues to report bugs, browses discussions for community support, and accesses wikis for in-depth tutorials - all through consistent, accessible interface elements.

### Developer Contribution Pathways

As an open source contributor, I want easy access to project issue trackers and discussion forums from the app portfolio, so that I can quickly identify contribution opportunities and connect with project maintainers.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer discovers an interesting app through the portfolio, views the app detail page, clicks the issues link to see current bugs and feature requests, visits discussions to understand project roadmap and community needs, accesses documentation to understand architecture before contributing.

## Spec Scope

1. **Extended YAML Schema** - Add optional fields for docs_url, wiki_url, issues_url, discussions_url to app.yml structure
2. **Resource Links UI** - Display resource links in a dedicated section on individual app pages with appropriate icons and descriptions
3. **Link Validation** - Implement basic URL format validation and accessibility checking for provided resources
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Ensure existing apps without new fields continue to function normally
5. **Documentation Update** - Update data schema documentation to reflect new fields and usage examples

## Out of Scope

- Automatic detection or scraping of resource URLs from GitHub repositories
- Real-time monitoring of link availability or content changes
- Advanced analytics on resource link usage
- Integration with external API services for link metadata

## Expected Deliverable

1. All app entries can optionally include comprehensive resource links without breaking existing functionality
2. App detail pages display resource links in an organized, accessible section when available
3. New apps can be added with full resource metadata following clear documentation guidelines
