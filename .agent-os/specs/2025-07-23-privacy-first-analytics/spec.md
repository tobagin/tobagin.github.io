> Spec: Privacy-First Analytics and User Insights
> Created: 2025-07-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive privacy-respecting analytics system that tracks user behavior and app engagement patterns without compromising user privacy or violating data protection regulations. This system will provide actionable insights to improve app discoverability and user experience while maintaining the GNOME Portfolio's commitment to privacy-first design principles.

## User Stories

### Analytics Administrator Story

As a site administrator, I want to understand which applications are most popular and how users navigate the site, so that I can improve content curation and user experience without tracking personally identifiable information.

The system will collect aggregated, anonymous metrics on page views, app interactions, search queries (without personal data), and user flow patterns. All data will be stored locally or in privacy-focused analytics services, with no third-party tracking cookies or personal data collection. Analytics dashboards will provide insights on app popularity trends, user engagement patterns, and areas for site improvement.

### User Privacy Story

As a privacy-conscious GNOME user, I want to browse and discover applications without being tracked or having my data collected, so that I can maintain my privacy while benefiting from an optimized user experience.

The analytics system will operate transparently with clear privacy notices, no tracking cookies, and compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations. Users will have full control over their data with easy opt-out mechanisms, and all collected data will be anonymized and aggregated.

### Site Improvement Story

As a content curator, I want to understand which apps users find most valuable and where they encounter difficulties, so that I can prioritize content improvements and optimize the discovery experience.

The system will provide insights into user journey patterns, popular search terms, successful app discoveries, and potential friction points in the user experience. This data will inform decisions about app curation, UI improvements, and content organization.

## Spec Scope

1. **Privacy-First Analytics Core** - Implement self-hosted or privacy-focused analytics solution with no tracking cookies
2. **App Engagement Metrics** - Track app page views, clicks to external resources, and engagement patterns
3. **User Journey Analysis** - Monitor navigation patterns, search behavior, and discovery paths
4. **Performance Impact Monitoring** - Ensure analytics implementation maintains Core Web Vitals scores >90
5. **Privacy Compliance Framework** - Implement GDPR-compliant data handling with clear privacy notices

## Out of Scope

- Personal data collection or user identification
- Third-party analytics services that compromise privacy (Google Analytics, etc.)
- Real-time analytics dashboards (static reports are sufficient)
- User account-based tracking or personalization
- Cross-site tracking or data sharing with external services

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Privacy-compliant analytics system** - Functional analytics collecting anonymous, aggregated data with no privacy violations
2. **App popularity insights** - Clear metrics showing which applications receive most engagement and user interest
3. **User journey understanding** - Data showing how users discover apps, common navigation patterns, and optimization opportunities
