**Load Testing**
- Test analytics performance with high event frequency
- Test data aggregation performance with large datasets
- Test browser performance with analytics running continuously
- Test impact on mobile device performance
- Test graceful degradation when analytics fail

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End User Journeys**
- User visits site, browses apps, and interacts with resources
- User searches for apps and clicks through to external resources
- User opts out of analytics and verifies no data collection
- User with Do Not Track enabled experiences no tracking
- Site administrator exports analytics data for review

**Privacy-First User Experience**
- Privacy-conscious user can easily understand data collection
- User can opt out with one click and preference persists
- EU user sees appropriate consent mechanisms
- Analytics-blocked user experiences full site functionality
- Data export contains only anonymous, aggregated information

### Browser Compatibility Tests

**Cross-Browser Analytics**
- Test analytics functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Test privacy features work consistently across browsers
- Test opt-out mechanisms function in all supported browsers
- Test performance impact consistent across browser engines
- Test graceful fallback when JavaScript is disabled

### Mocking Requirements

**Analytics Service Mocking**
- Mock sessionStorage for testing data persistence behavior
- Mock Do Not Track header values for privacy testing
- Mock performance timing APIs for performance impact testing
- Mock network conditions for testing graceful degradation
- Mock date/time functions for consistent timestamp testing

**Privacy Compliance Mocking**
- Mock geolocation detection for GDPR compliance testing
- Mock consent management responses for EU user testing
- Mock browser privacy settings for comprehensive privacy testing
- Mock external service responses for data export testing

## Test Data Strategy

### Anonymous Test Data
- Use completely anonymous, fictional app interaction data
- Generate realistic but non-personal search query patterns
- Create diverse user journey scenarios without any PII
- Test with various traffic patterns and usage spikes
- Validate data anonymization with edge cases

### Privacy Testing Data
- Test opt-out scenarios with various user configurations
- Validate GDPR compliance with different consent states
- Test data retention and expiration policies
- Verify no data leakage in privacy-restricted scenarios
- Test cross-session privacy preservation
