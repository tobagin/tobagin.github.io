# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-23-privacy-first-analytics/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-23
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **No-Cookie Analytics**: Analytics must function without storing tracking cookies or persistent identifiers
- **Client-Side Data Collection**: Use JavaScript to collect anonymous, aggregated metrics without server-side tracking
- **Performance Constraint**: Analytics code must not negatively impact Core Web Vitals scores (maintain >90)
- **Privacy-First Storage**: All data must be anonymized and aggregated before storage
- **Minimal JavaScript Overhead**: Analytics script should be <5KB compressed to maintain site performance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance with European data protection regulations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Site must function fully with analytics disabled or blocked

## Approach Options

**Option A: Self-Hosted Plausible Analytics**
- Pros: Open source, privacy-focused, lightweight, no cookies, GDPR compliant
- Cons: Requires separate hosting/maintenance, additional infrastructure cost

**Option B: Privacy-Focused SaaS (Simple Analytics, Fathom)**
- Pros: No maintenance overhead, privacy-compliant, lightweight scripts
- Cons: External dependency, recurring cost, less customization control

**Option C: Custom Client-Side Analytics with Local Storage** (Selected)
- Pros: Full control, no external dependencies, perfectly aligned with static site, zero cost
- Cons: Custom development required, limited to basic metrics

**Rationale:** Option C aligns best with the project's static site architecture, privacy-first principles, and zero-cost hosting on GitHub Pages. Custom implementation allows precise control over data collection and ensures perfect compliance with privacy requirements.

## External Dependencies

- **No new external dependencies required**
- **Justification:** Custom implementation using vanilla JavaScript maintains the project's lightweight, dependency-free approach while ensuring complete privacy control

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Collection Strategy
- Anonymous session-based tracking using sessionStorage (no persistence across sessions)
- Page view tracking with path, timestamp, and referrer (anonymized)
- Interaction tracking for app links, search usage, and category filtering
- No IP address logging, user agent fingerprinting, or personal data collection

### Data Storage Approach
- Client-side aggregation before any data transmission
- Optional: Periodic anonymous data export to GitHub repository for analysis
- All data stored as anonymous, aggregated statistics
- No individual user tracking or session reconstruction possible

### Privacy Safeguards
- Clear privacy notice in site footer
- Easy opt-out mechanism via browser settings or site toggle
- Automatic respect for Do Not Track headers
- No data collection in EU regions without explicit consent
- Data retention policy with automatic expiration
