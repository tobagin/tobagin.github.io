# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-search-discovery-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**FilterManager (JavaScript)**
- Search filtering returns correct results for name matches
- Search filtering returns correct results for tagline matches  
- Search filtering is case-insensitive
- Category filtering shows only apps in selected category
- Tag filtering shows only apps with ALL selected tags
- Combined search + category + tag filtering works correctly
- Empty search shows all apps
- Search with no results shows empty state

**Data Validation**
- All apps have required category field
- All categories match predefined list
- Tags array is valid format (array of strings)
- Apps with invalid data are rejected during build

### Integration Tests

**Search Interface**
- Search input triggers filtering in real-time
- Search results update as user types
- Search input can be cleared to reset results
- Search persists when category/tag filters are changed

**Category Filtering**
- Category buttons/dropdown properly filter app grid
- Only one category can be active at a time
- "All" category shows all apps
- Category selection persists during search operations
- Category filter combines properly with search and tags

**Tag Filtering**
- Tag selection adds to active filter set
- Multiple tags can be selected simultaneously  
- Tag removal updates filter results immediately
- Tag filtering uses AND logic (intersection)
- Tag filter combines properly with search and category

**Visual State Management**
- Filtered apps are hidden/faded appropriately
- Active filters are visually indicated
- Filter counters show correct numbers
- Loading states display during filter operations

### End-to-End User Workflows

**Discovery Workflow**
- User can arrive at site and immediately see all apps
- User can search for "password" and see Secrets Manager
- User can filter by "Development" category and see Sonar
- User can select "gtk4" tag and see all GTK4 apps
- User can combine search "matrix" + category "Network" + tag "chat"

**Filter Management Workflow**
- User can apply multiple filters and then clear them individually
- User can reset all filters to return to full app grid
- User can bookmark/share URL with active filters (if implemented)
- User can navigate back and have filters persist or reset appropriately

### Accessibility Testing

**Keyboard Navigation**
- All filter controls can be reached via Tab navigation
- Filter selection can be changed with Enter/Space keys
- Search input supports standard text navigation keys
- Focus indicators are clearly visible on all interactive elements

**Screen Reader Support**
- Filter controls announce their current state
- Search results are announced when they change
- Filter removal options are clearly labeled
- App count/result status is communicated to screen readers

### Performance Testing

**Response Time Requirements**
- Search filtering completes within 100ms for up to 100 apps
- Category filtering completes within 50ms
- Tag filtering completes within 100ms for complex multi-tag queries
- Combined filtering (search + category + tags) completes within 150ms

**Memory Usage**
- JavaScript filter state remains under 1MB for 100 apps
- No memory leaks during repeated filter operations
- DOM manipulation doesn't cause layout thrashing

### Mocking Requirements

- **No external services to mock** - All functionality is client-side
- **Test data setup:** Create fixture apps.yml with diverse categories and tags for comprehensive testing
- **DOM testing:** Use JSDOM or similar for testing JavaScript filtering logic without browser
