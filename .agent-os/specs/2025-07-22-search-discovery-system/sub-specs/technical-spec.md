# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-search-discovery-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Category System**: Add `category` field to _data/apps.yml schema with predefined category list
- **Tag System**: Add `tags` array field to _data/apps.yml for flexible tagging
- **Search Functionality**: Vanilla JavaScript search that filters DOM elements in real-time
- **Category Filtering**: UI component for category selection with visual state management
- **Tag Filtering**: Multi-select interface allowing tag intersection filtering
- **Performance**: Maintain <100ms response time for search and filter operations
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all filter controls
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly filter controls that work on mobile devices

## Approach Options

**Option A: DOM Manipulation Approach**
- Pros: Simple implementation, works with existing Jekyll static generation, no complex state management
- Cons: Potential performance issues with large app catalogs, limited to client-side data

**Option B: JavaScript State Management Approach** (Selected)
- Pros: Better performance, more maintainable, easier to extend with analytics later
- Cons: Slightly more complex initial setup, requires more JavaScript

**Option C: Server-Side Filtering with Jekyll**
- Pros: SEO-friendly filtered pages, works without JavaScript
- Cons: No real-time search, complex URL management, many generated pages

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of performance and maintainability while keeping the implementation simple enough for the current tech stack. It enables real-time filtering without requiring server-side complexity.

## External Dependencies

- **No new libraries required**
- **Justification:** The vanilla JavaScript approach aligns with the project's minimal dependency philosophy and provides sufficient functionality for the current requirements

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Schema Changes
```yaml
# _data/apps.yml additions
- name: "App Name"
  # ... existing fields ...
  category: "Development"  # Single category from predefined list
  tags: ["gtk4", "rust", "networking"]  # Array of flexible tags
```

### JavaScript Architecture
```javascript
// Search and filter state management
const FilterManager = {
  state: {
    searchTerm: '',
    selectedCategory: 'all',
    selectedTags: new Set()
  },
  
  // Filter application logic
  filterApps: function() {
    // Apply combined filters to app grid
  }
}
```

### Category System
- Predefined categories: Development, Graphics, Productivity, System, Network, Entertainment, Education, Accessibility
- Single category per app for clear categorization
- Category filter as radio button selection (one active at a time)

### Tag System  
- Free-form tags for cross-cutting concerns (technologies, patterns, features)
- Multiple tags per app supported
- Tag filtering uses intersection logic (AND operation)
- Tags displayed as clickable chips with remove functionality
