# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Search and Discovery System
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive search and discovery system that completes Phase 1's categorization features and delivers Phase 2's search functionality. This enables users to efficiently find GNOME applications through multiple discovery paths including real-time search, category filtering, and tag-based exploration.

## User Stories

### Efficient App Discovery

As a GNOME user, I want to quickly search for applications by name or description, so that I can find relevant tools without browsing through the entire catalog.

**Detailed Workflow:** User arrives at the portfolio homepage, types keywords into a prominent search box, and sees filtered results update in real-time as they type. Results are visually filtered in the existing grid layout with non-matching apps fading out or being hidden entirely.

### Category-Based Browsing

As a GNOME newcomer, I want to browse applications by category (like "Graphics", "Development", "Productivity"), so that I can discover apps for specific use cases even when I don't know what to search for.

**Detailed Workflow:** User sees category filter buttons or dropdown prominently displayed, clicks on a category of interest, and the app grid filters to show only applications in that category. Category selection persists during search operations for refined discovery.

### Multi-Tag Filtering

As a developer, I want to filter applications by multiple tags (like "Rust" + "GTK4" + "Network"), so that I can find apps that demonstrate specific technical patterns or solve particular problems.

**Detailed Workflow:** User selects multiple tags from an available tag list, sees the app grid filter to show only applications that match ALL selected tags, and can easily remove individual tags to broaden or adjust their filter criteria.

## Spec Scope

1. **App Categories System** - Add category field to app data schema and implement category-based filtering UI
2. **Tag System Implementation** - Add flexible tagging support to app data with multi-tag filtering logic  
3. **Real-Time Search** - Client-side search functionality that filters apps by name and description as user types
4. **Category Filter UI** - Clean category selection interface integrated with existing design system
5. **Tag Filter Interface** - Multi-select tag filtering with clear visual feedback for active selections

## Out of Scope

- Search analytics or tracking (reserved for Phase 4)
- Advanced search features like fuzzy matching or search suggestions
- Server-side search or external search engines
- Search result ranking beyond alphabetical sorting
- Saved searches or search history
- Keyboard shortcuts for search (reserved for Phase 2 should-have features)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Categories are functional** - Users can filter the app grid by selecting categories with immediate visual feedback
2. **Tags are working** - Users can apply multiple tag filters that properly intersect to show matching applications
3. **Search is responsive** - Typing in the search box immediately filters the visible applications in real-time
