## Pitch

GNOME Portfolio is a Jekyll-based portfolio website that helps GNOME users discover and access quality applications by providing a centralized hub with comprehensive links to Flathub, GitHub resources, documentation, and community discussions.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **GNOME Users**: Linux enthusiasts and everyday users looking to discover and install quality GNOME applications
- **Open Source Contributors**: Developers wanting to contribute to existing GNOME projects or find inspiration for their own apps
- **App Discovery Seekers**: Users who prefer curated application collections over searching through thousands of Flathub entries

### User Personas

**Linux Enthusiast** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Software Developer, System Administrator, or Power User
- **Context:** Uses GNOME desktop environment and values native, well-designed applications
- **Pain Points:** Flathub's vast catalog makes it hard to find quality apps, difficult to access all project resources from one place
- **Goals:** Discover well-maintained GNOME apps, easily access documentation and issue trackers, contribute to open source projects

**GNOME Newcomer** (18-35 years old)
- **Role:** Student, Professional, or Curious User
- **Context:** Recently switched to Linux/GNOME and wants to build their application toolkit
- **Pain Points:** Overwhelmed by application choices, unsure which apps are actively maintained, hard to find help resources
- **Goals:** Find reliable, user-friendly applications, access clear documentation, connect with supportive communities

## The Problem

### Application Discovery Fragmentation

GNOME users struggle to discover quality applications because information is scattered across multiple platforms. A user might find an app on Flathub but then need to visit separate GitHub repos for documentation, wikis for guides, and discussion boards for community support.

**Our Solution:** Provide a single, curated hub that connects users to all resources for each application in one place.

### Quality Signal Noise

With thousands of applications available, users have difficulty identifying which apps are actively maintained, well-designed, and follow GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.

**Our Solution:** Curate a focused collection of high-quality GNOME applications that demonstrate good design patterns and active maintenance.

### Resource Accessibility Barriers

Even when users find promising applications, accessing documentation, filing issues, or joining discussions requires navigating multiple different platforms and interfaces.

**Our Solution:** Present all application resources through consistent, accessible interfaces that follow GNOME design principles.

## Differentiators

### Curated Quality Over Quantity

Unlike Flathub's comprehensive catalog approach, we provide a carefully selected collection of applications that represent the best of GNOME software. This results in users spending less time searching and more time using great applications.

### Unified Resource Access

Unlike scattered GitHub repos and documentation sites, we provide comprehensive access to all project resources (issues, docs, wikis, discussions) through a single, consistent interface. This results in 50% faster access to support resources.

### GNOME-Native Experience

Unlike generic portfolio themes, we provide an authentic GNOME experience using Adwaita design principles and native interaction patterns. This results in a familiar, comfortable experience for GNOME users.
