## 2025-01-25: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create a Jekyll-based GNOME application portfolio website that serves as a curated hub for discovering quality GNOME applications. Target GNOME users, open source contributors, and newcomers to the ecosystem with comprehensive resource access through a single, beautifully designed interface.

### Context

GNOME users face fragmented application discovery experiences across Flathub, GitHub, documentation sites, and community forums. Quality applications get lost in the noise of thousands of available packages, and accessing support resources requires navigating multiple platforms with inconsistent interfaces. There's an opportunity to create a curated, high-quality experience that showcases the best of GNOME software while providing unified access to all project resources.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Flathub Integration App**
   - Pros: Direct integration with existing ecosystem, comprehensive data
   - Cons: Limited curatorial control, maintains fragmentation problem

2. **Generic Portfolio Website**
   - Pros: Simple to build, total creative control
   - Cons: Doesn't solve resource fragmentation, lacks GNOME-native feel

3. **Dynamic Web Application**
   - Pros: Rich interactions, real-time data
   - Cons: Complexity overhead, hosting costs, maintenance burden

### Rationale

Jekyll strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power for this use case. Static generation ensures fast loading and easy hosting while providing enough flexibility for data-driven content generation. The GNOME design system approach creates authentic user experience for the target audience. Curated approach over comprehensive catalog ensures quality over quantity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast, reliable static site with excellent performance
- Authentic GNOME experience builds trust with target users
- GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting with version control
- Jekyll's data-driven approach scales well for adding new applications
- Community can contribute via familiar GitHub workflow

**Negative:**
- Manual curation creates maintenance overhead
- Static approach limits real-time integrations
- Requires ongoing content management and quality control
- Success depends on building community of contributors
