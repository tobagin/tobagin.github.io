## 2025-01-25: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create a Jekyll-based GNOME application portfolio website that serves as a curated hub for discovering quality GNOME applications. Target GNOME users, open source contributors, and newcomers to the ecosystem with comprehensive resource access through a single, beautifully designed interface.

### Context

GNOME users face fragmented application discovery experiences across Flathub, GitHub, documentation sites, and community forums. Quality applications get lost in the noise of thousands of available packages, and accessing support resources requires navigating multiple platforms with inconsistent interfaces. There's an opportunity to create a curated, high-quality experience that showcases the best of GNOME software while providing unified access to all project resources.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Flathub Integration App**
   - Pros: Direct integration with existing ecosystem, comprehensive data
   - Cons: Limited curatorial control, maintains fragmentation problem

2. **Generic Portfolio Website**
   - Pros: Simple to build, total creative control
   - Cons: Doesn't solve resource fragmentation, lacks GNOME-native feel

3. **Dynamic Web Application**
   - Pros: Rich interactions, real-time data
   - Cons: Complexity overhead, hosting costs, maintenance burden

### Rationale

Jekyll strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power for this use case. Static generation ensures fast loading and easy hosting while providing enough flexibility for data-driven content generation. The GNOME design system approach creates authentic user experience for the target audience. Curated approach over comprehensive catalog ensures quality over quantity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast, reliable static site with excellent performance
- Authentic GNOME experience builds trust with target users
- GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting with version control
- Jekyll's data-driven approach scales well for adding new applications
- Community can contribute via familiar GitHub workflow

**Negative:**
- Manual curation creates maintenance overhead
- Static approach limits real-time integrations
- Requires ongoing content management and quality control
- Success depends on building community of contributors

## 2025-07-23: Privacy-First Analytics Implementation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-23-privacy-first-analytics/
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Privacy Advocates

### Decision

Implement a custom, privacy-first analytics system that collects anonymous, aggregated usage data without cookies, personal identification, or third-party tracking services. This system will provide insights into app popularity and user behavior while maintaining absolute user privacy.

### Context

To improve the GNOME Portfolio's app curation and user experience, we need usage insights about which apps are popular, how users navigate the site, and where they encounter difficulties. However, the GNOME community values privacy highly, and implementing traditional analytics (Google Analytics, etc.) would compromise user trust and potentially violate privacy regulations.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Google Analytics or Similar**
   - Pros: Comprehensive features, easy implementation, industry standard
   - Cons: Privacy violations, cookie tracking, data sharing with third parties

2. **Privacy-Focused SaaS (Plausible, Fathom)**
   - Pros: Privacy-compliant, no cookies, lightweight
   - Cons: External dependency, recurring costs, less customization

3. **No Analytics**
   - Pros: Complete privacy, no implementation overhead
   - Cons: No insights for improving user experience or content curation

### Rationale

Custom privacy-first analytics aligns perfectly with GNOME's privacy values and the project's static site architecture. By implementing client-side, anonymous data collection with explicit privacy safeguards, we can gain valuable insights while maintaining user trust. This approach also eliminates external dependencies and costs while providing complete control over data handling.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Maintains user privacy and trust with GNOME community
- Provides actionable insights for improving app curation
- No external dependencies or recurring costs
- Full compliance with GDPR and privacy regulations
- Custom implementation fits perfectly with static site architecture

**Negative:**
- Requires custom development and maintenance
- Limited analytics features compared to commercial solutions
- Dependent on JavaScript being enabled (with graceful degradation)
- Manual analysis required for insights (no real-time dashboards)
